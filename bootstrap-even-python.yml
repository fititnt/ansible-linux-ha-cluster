# DESCRIPTION:     This is one way to use the AP-ALB to install Python with
#                  raw SSH commands. You do not need to leave
#                  alb_boostrap_python on your playbooks

# To run on all hosts from a playbook named "hosts.yml" on the current directory:
#     ansible-playbook bootstrap-even-python.yml -i hosts.yml
# To run on a IP or adress, without a hosts file (note the ',', thats important)
#     ansible-playbook bootstrap-even-python.yml -i example.org,

- name: "bootstrap-even-python.yml"
  hosts: all
  remote_user: root
  gather_facts: false
  vars:
    # both and alb_boostrap_python="force" must be enabled to allow try install Python with raw SSH commands
    alb_boostrap_python: "force"
  roles:
    - ap-application-load-balancer

# Note: you actually can use ANY playbook that requires ap-application-load-balancer
# but you set gather_facts: false on the playbook, to not leave this option enabled
# just run with 
#     ansible-playbook my-playbook-with-gather_facts-false.yml -i example.org, -e='alb_boostrap_python=force'
